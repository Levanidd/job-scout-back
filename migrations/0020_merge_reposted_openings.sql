-- A board that takes an opening down and re-publishes it gives it a new id, and
-- by then our row for the old id is closed. Ingest used to look for twins among
-- open rows only, so the reposting landed as a brand-new vacancy and the person
-- who had already applied was shown it again. Ingest now merges the two; this
-- repairs the rows that slipped through, but only where someone acted on the
-- retired copy deliberately. Closed duplicates nobody touched are left alone.
